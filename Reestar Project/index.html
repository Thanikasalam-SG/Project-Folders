        <h1 style="margin-top: 20px;">About us</h1>
        <p>A restaurant is an establishment where food and beverages are prepared and served to customers. It offers a variety of cuisines, ranging from local delicacies to international dishes, catering to diverse tastes and preferences. The atmosphere of a restaurant plays a crucial role in the dining experience, often designed to complement the type of cuisine offeredâ€”whether it's casual, fine dining, or fast food.
            Restaurants come in various types, including family-style, fast-casual, and gourmet. Each type aims to cater to different audiences based on pricing, service, and quality. For example, fast-food restaurants prioritize speed and convenience, offering quick meals at affordable prices. On the other hand, fine dining establishments focus on a premium experience with carefully curated dishes, high-quality ingredients, and attentive service.
            The restaurant industry is vital to the economy, providing jobs in areas like cooking, serving, and management. Beyond serving food, restaurants also offer a social space for people to gather, celebrate, or conduct business. With the rise of technology, many restaurants now provide online ordering and delivery services, making it easier for customers to enjoy their favorite meals at home.
            In recent years, restaurants have also become more health-conscious, offering organic, vegetarian, and vegan options to meet the growing demand for healthier dining choices. Whether for a quick bite or a leisurely meal, restaurants remain a cornerstone of social and culinary life.
